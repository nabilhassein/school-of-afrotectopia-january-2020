## Abstract
Recent academic, artistic, and activist work has foregrounded the materiality of computing by drawing attention to the immense ecological impact of mining, manufacturing, data centers, undersea cables, and other physical infrastructure required to present the abstraction of "the cloud", which is still too often discussed as if it is immaterial. In fact, both hardware and software contribute directly and enormously to carbon emissions, as well as directly or indirectly supporting anti-Black (and anti-Earth) systems of resource extraction, labor exploitation, policing, incarceration, and imperialism.

In this seminar, following a presentation from Nabil, we will collectively discuss a number of optional texts from the below mini-syllabus exploring these topics, including broader Black critiques of technology and society. Against anti-Black imaginaries of our people's disappearance, we will read through a speculative lens that takes Black survival and futurity for granted, in order to imagine our own positionality in the possible futures of interest to participants in the class, and consider what our hopes and desires for the future mean for our actions in the present.


## Required materials
Nothing is required to bring to class except your own willingness to learn and contribute to others' learning.
You are welcome to bring a laptop, tablet, paper notebook, print-outs of readings, or other technology for note-taking and reference to readings and your own thoughts.


## Optional Readings
I do not expect anyone to be able to get through most of this material before class time.
However, I encourage you take a look at one or several of these texts (including also illustrations, a recorded conference presentation, and other media forms) before class to get your thoughts going, based on whatever you have time for and what piques your interest!
I will cite and distribute a more extensive reading list (which I am far from finishing myself) during and after class.
